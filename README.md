# Minecraft-Scripts
Python scripts for modifying Minecraft save files

These scripts are old versions that work on the alpha .mclevel files. Because the format was so much simpler, I included all the interface code with each script. There is also a stand-alone interface file for if you want to make a new script that uses that code. I got tired of updating all of the files every time there was a change made to the interface code, so the interface file is split out for the other scripts. I suppose I could convert these old scripts to use the new system, but I haven't done so yet.
